# initproject
Tools to help start a new r analysis project

This is a simple package to make analysis projects faster and more streamlined.  

It does only a few things.  

makeDirs() will, given a project_name, make project directories (datadir, rdir, resultsdir) 
in the location that I like (~/Documents/coding/project_name).  

establishPaths() will, given a project_name,  load the standard dirs for that project into memory
